# C-NOMA-SWIPT
## INTRODUCTION
 
The system modeled in this project is the Cooperative Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access System based on Power Splitting Architecture (C-NOMA SWIPT). This system combines the SWIPT technology with the collaborative NOMA communication mechanism, in which the near user receives signals while harvesting energy, and utilizes the harvested energy to forward the far user's information in the collaborative phase, thus improving the spectral efficiency and communication reliability of the system.

The script files in this code package correspond to the system models constructed in Chapters 3 and 4 of the thesis, and their simulation results are presented in Figures 6.1 to 6.10 in Chapter 6. The specific correspondences are as follows:

1. figure 6.1 SwiptOma.mlx
2. fugure 6.2 SwiptOmaSplitRatio.mlx
3. figure 6.3 SwiptOmaDistance.mlx
4. fugure 6.4/6.5 CNomaSwiptFinal.mlx
5. fugure 6.6.6.7 CNomaSwiptSplittingRatio.mlx
6. figure 6.8/6.9 CNomaSwiptDistance.mlx
7. figure 6.10 rate_transpower_differentsystem.mlx
## User Installation Instructions 
This guide will walk you through installing and running this MATLAB project on your system.
Before you begin, make sure you have:

1.Sufficient disk space and memory for simulation

2.MATLAB R2023b or newer (recommended). you can install matlab in web page: https://uk.mathworks.com/campaigns/products/trials.html

 
## How to run the code
**1. Clone the repository**

download the mlx file to your computer.

**2. Open MATLAB and Set Path**

Open MATLAB, click open button at the upper left of the window. than choice the file you want to use.

**3. Run the simulation**

you can click the green button at the top of the Matlab runing window to run the simulation code, after few seconds, the figure will presented on the right side of the code.

## Technical detail

It would be too complicated to elaborate on the formulas here; see chapters 3 and 4 of the report for details.
